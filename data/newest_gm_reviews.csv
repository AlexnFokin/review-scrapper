ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobThlaUNBEAE,"Horrible experience trying to get a new patient appointment. Staff was unable to get appt to see MD for 4 months...I was diagnosed with cancer on 2/6, and this office couldn't get me an appt to see a PCP until April! I was understandably upset about not being offered a sooner appt and called the staff out. The office manager then got on the line and told me the Doctor had been listening on the line and had decided to not see me as a patient. Thanks to this...I have been unable to see an oncologist...due to not having a PCP authorization. Horrible experience with this office. I would not recommend to my worst enemy. This has caused a huge delay in my care and I'm still fighting with insurance now to see an oncologist due to not having a PCP Auth. I switched my insurance to PPO effective March 1...but this whole ordeal has cost me multiple weeks and has created barriers to my care and detriment to my health and wellness. If I could I give 0 stars I would.",a month ago,2023-04-04 09:38:06.438978,,Sharon Sudnik,0,VIPcare Belleview
