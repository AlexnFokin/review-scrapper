ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldmI2SjNnRRAB,"1st time in this office. Took my sister n law. to her new primary Dr. Belanger. You never know what to expect when going to a new Dr. It can be very nerve wrecking and quite scary. However, from the beginning to the end. It was great, the beautiful ladies at the front desk were so nice and helpful. Dr Belanger is a Gem of a Dr. You not only see that she cares. She SHOW'S it and you feel it. She is very adamant in making sure her patient completely understands what and why she's doing or ordering certain medical things for you. She takes her time with you. She goes through your entire medical record to make certain she knows your medical history. If I did not live so far away. I would definitely make her my primary Care Dr. And again, the front desk and the PA absolutely great. The office offers a coffee and water machine and is very welcoming. Kudos to this Dr. and her staff.",5 months ago,2023-03-06 08:29:22.924790,5.0,Veronica Voncile,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103863803491352659588/reviews?hl=en-US
